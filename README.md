# Bank Churn Machine Learning Project

A Python Jupyter notebook to predict the churn of retail banking customers. 

For this project, our team ran several machine learning models such as K-nearest neighbors and logistic regression to identify which customers would close their accounts with the bank in the next 6 months. In addition, models were created to determine which of these customers the bank should concentrate on retaining. Retention measures were also proposed to persuade customers to stay with the bank
